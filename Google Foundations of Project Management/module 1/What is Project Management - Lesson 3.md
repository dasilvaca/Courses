# What is Project Management?

 project is a unique endeavor, and usually includes a set of unique deliverables. It's also a temporary pursuit, it has a defined beginning and an end. To put it another way, a project is a series of tasks that need to be completed to reach a desired outcome. Reaching that desired outcome takes collaboration and careful planning that keeps the project on track and on budget, that's where project management comes in.
