# Courses

Well, this is my knowledge center corner. As it might be or not obvious, the intention of this repository is to be not just a knowledge center, but an space for taking notes, making exercises, and why not be kind of a forum. 

Most of the notes will be made on MarkDown, because I am used to it.

Each course might have it's own Readme.MD for the intention of the course, some might be divided by sections, other might have exercises already solved, so... Anyone on the internet who feels stucked with something can checck it out right here (or, at least what I wait for, is to start receiving suggestions for better approaches for those solutions)

## Requirements?

Well, as you might or not clone/fork this repository, I can start sharing the extensions I keep using them for, the content this repo has (as, well, I want to organize them by using branches). For sure, if you do, install Git (if you haven't done it yet).

I am using VSCode as mi text editor, and for now, I am just using markdownlint, in order to see how my typing is going.

That's all for now! This might be the beginning of my daily commit challenge!

## Content

Well, the first thing I'd like to do is give this something like an structure. Then, the first approach I've decided to have is to have each of the courses source independant, as for me and everyone (at least that's what I think) the source might be irrelevant, as the interesting thing is the content itselef. The following must work as table contents:

- [C For Everyone [Programming Foundamentals]](./C%20for%20everyone%20[Programming%20Fundamentals]/)
- [C For Everyone [Structured Programming]](./C%20for%20Everyone[Structured%20Programming]/)
- [Vim](./Vim/)
